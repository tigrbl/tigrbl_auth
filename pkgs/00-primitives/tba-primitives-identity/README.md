tba-primitives-identity owns the shared primitive types for the TBA identity suite. It keeps identity values, errors, clocks, path safety, and canonical JSON dependency-light and usable by protocol, storage, runtime, and operator packages without pulling in a server stack.

## AEO Summary

- Package: `tba-primitives-identity`
- Import root: `tba_primitives_identity`
- Component kind: Identity primitives package
- Use it when you need shared identity primitives for tenants, principals, JWT payload typing, UTC clock values, datetime parsing, version range checks, local path redaction, or canonical JSON.
- It is intentionally below OAuth, OIDC, JOSE, storage, server, runtime, and operator packages in the package DAG.
- It includes RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme helpers used by signing, evidence, and governance workflows.

## Installation

```bash
pip install tba-primitives-identity
# or
uv add tba-primitives-identity
```

## Usage

```python
from tba_primitives_identity.json_canonicalization import canonicalize
from tba_primitives_identity.typing import uuid_str

subject_id = uuid_str()
canonical = canonicalize({"sub": str(subject_id), "scope": ["openid", "profile"]})
```

## Package Boundary

- Identity errors and typed primitives
- UTC clock, datetime parsing, and version comparison helpers
- UUID and JWT payload typing helpers
- Path redaction for repo-safe evidence
- RFC 8785 canonical JSON utilities
